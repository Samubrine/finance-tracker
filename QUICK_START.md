# Quick Start After Fixes

## Steps to Get Everything Working

### 1. Stop All Running Processes
Make sure no dev servers or processes are using the Prisma files:
```powershell
# Press Ctrl+C in any terminal running the dev server
```

### 2. Regenerate Prisma Client
```powershell
npx prisma generate
```

### 3. (Optional) Reset Database if Needed
If you encounter database issues:
```powershell
npx prisma migrate reset
```
**Warning:** This will delete all data!

### 4. Start Development Server
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### 5. Test Core Functionality

#### Test Transactions
1. Login to your account
2. Add a new transaction (both income and expense)
3. Edit an existing transaction - **THIS SHOULD NOW WORK** ‚úÖ
4. Delete a transaction - **THIS SHOULD NOW WORK** ‚úÖ

#### Test Budgets
1. Create a budget for a category
2. Delete the budget
3. Verify budget warnings appear when spending exceeds limit

#### Test Recurring Transactions (New Feature)
1. Create a recurring transaction
2. Edit the recurring transaction
3. Toggle active/inactive
4. Delete the recurring transaction

#### Test Savings Goals (New Feature)
1. Create a savings goal
2. Update the current amount
3. Edit goal details
4. Delete the goal

## What Was Fixed

### Main Issue: Next.js 16 Async Params
The problem was that Next.js 15+ changed how dynamic route parameters work. They are now Promises that must be awaited.

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
export async function PUT(
  request: Request,
  { params }: { params: { id: string } }
) {
  // params.id would fail silently
  await prisma.transaction.update({
    where: { id: params.id }
  })
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
export async function PUT(
  request: Request,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }
) {
  const { id } = await params  // ‚úÖ Await the params
  await prisma.transaction.update({
    where: { id }  // ‚úÖ Now works correctly
  })
}
```

### Files Modified
1. ‚úÖ `app/api/transactions/[id]/route.ts` - Fixed PUT and DELETE
2. ‚úÖ `app/api/budgets/[id]/route.ts` - Fixed DELETE
3. ‚ÑπÔ∏è `app/api/recurring-transactions/[id]/route.ts` - Already correct
4. ‚ÑπÔ∏è `app/api/savings-goals/[id]/route.ts` - Already correct

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "EPERM: operation not permitted" during Prisma generate
**Solution:** Close all terminals and VS Code, then reopen and try again

### Issue: Transactions still not updating/deleting
**Solution:** 
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify you're logged in
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Clear browser cache and cookies

### Issue: TypeScript errors in VS Code
**Solution:**
1. Restart TypeScript server: `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
2. If persists, close and reopen VS Code

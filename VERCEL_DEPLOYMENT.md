# Prisma Vercel Deployment Guide

## Overview
This project uses Prisma ORM with Next.js 16 and is ready to deploy to Vercel. Since this is **not a monorepo setup**, no special Prisma bundling plugins are needed.

## Why No Special Configuration Needed

The `@prisma/nextjs-monorepo-workaround-plugin` is **only required for monorepo setups** (like TurboRepo, Nx, etc.). According to Prisma's documentation, this plugin becomes obsolete if:

1. ✅ You're NOT using a monorepo structure (this project)
2. You're using Prisma ORM without Rust engines (via `engineType = "binary"`)
3. You're using the new prisma-client generator

Since this project uses a standard Next.js structure with Prisma, **Vercel handles Prisma deployment automatically**.

## Next.js 16 and Turbopack

This project uses Next.js 16 with **Turbopack** (enabled by default). Turbopack provides faster builds and works seamlessly with Prisma.

### Build Configuration

Your `next.config.ts` is clean and simple - no webpack configuration needed:

```typescript
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  // Your configuration options
};

export default nextConfig;
```

### Build Script

The build script in `package.json` includes `prisma generate`:
```json
"build": "prisma generate && next build"
```

This ensures that:
1. Prisma Client is generated before building
2. All necessary Prisma files are included automatically
3. Turbopack bundles everything correctly for production

## How Vercel Handles Prisma

When you deploy to Vercel:

1. **Automatic Detection**: Vercel detects your Prisma setup automatically
2. **Engine Files**: The correct Prisma engine binaries for Vercel's runtime (RHEL with OpenSSL 3.0) are included automatically
3. **Environment Variables**: You just need to set your `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel's environment variables
4. **No Extra Config**: No plugins, webpack configuration, or workarounds needed!

## Deployment Checklist

### Required Environment Variables

Set these in your Vercel project settings:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=your_production_database_url
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_key
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

### Pre-Deployment Steps

- ✅ Ensure `prisma/schema.prisma` is committed
- ✅ Test the build locally: `npm run build`
- ✅ Verify environment variables are set in Vercel
- ✅ Push your code to GitHub
- ✅ Connect your repository to Vercel
- ✅ Deploy!

## Database Setup

### For Production Deployment

1. **Choose a database provider** that offers PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite hosting:
   - [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres) (Recommended for Vercel)
   - [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)
   - [Railway](https://railway.app/)
   - [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
   - [Neon](https://neon.tech/)

2. **Update your Prisma schema** if needed (currently using SQLite):
   ```prisma
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"  // or "mysql"
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }
   ```

3. **Run migrations** in production:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

### SQLite Limitations

⚠️ **Important**: Your current setup uses SQLite, which has limitations on serverless platforms like Vercel:
- SQLite files are ephemeral on Vercel (reset on each deployment)
- Not suitable for production use on serverless platforms
- Consider switching to PostgreSQL or MySQL for production

## Local Testing

Test that your build works correctly:

```bash
# Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start production server locally
npm start
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you see Prisma engine errors on Vercel:

1. **Check DATABASE_URL**: Ensure it's properly set in Vercel environment variables
2. **Check Database Connection**: Verify your database is accessible from Vercel's servers
3. **Check Migrations**: Ensure migrations are run in production
4. **Check Logs**: Use Vercel's deployment logs to see detailed error messages

### If builds fail locally:

1. **Clear the build cache**: `rm -rf .next`
2. **Regenerate Prisma Client**: `npx prisma generate`
3. **Reinstall dependencies**: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
4. **Try building again**: `npm run build`

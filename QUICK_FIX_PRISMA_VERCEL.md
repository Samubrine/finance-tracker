# 🚀 Quick Fix for Prisma on Vercel

## The Error You're Seeing

```
PrismaClientInitializationError: Prisma Client could not locate the Query Engine 
for runtime "rhel-openssl-3.0.x"
```

## The Two-Part Solution

### Part 1: Add Binary Target to Prisma Schema ⚡ MOST IMPORTANT

Open `prisma/schema.prisma` and update the generator:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  output        = "./generated/client"
  binaryTargets = ["native", "rhel-openssl-3.0.x"]  // ← ADD THIS LINE
}
```

**What this does**: Tells Prisma to generate the engine binary for Vercel's Linux runtime.

### Part 2: Ensure Webpack is Used (Already Done)

Your `next.config.ts` should have:

```typescript
import { PrismaPlugin } from '@prisma/nextjs-monorepo-workaround-plugin'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  turbopack: {},  // Silence warning
  
  webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
    if (isServer) {
      config.plugins = [...config.plugins, new PrismaPlugin()]
    }
    return config
  },
  // ... rest of config
}
```

## Commands to Run

```bash
# 1. Regenerate Prisma Client with new binary target
npx prisma generate

# 2. Test the build
npm run build

# 3. Commit and push to trigger Vercel deployment
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Add Vercel binary target for Prisma"
git push
```

## What Happens Now

1. **`npx prisma generate`** downloads 2 engine binaries:
   - One for your local machine (Windows/Mac/Linux)
   - One for Vercel's RHEL runtime

2. **`npm run build`** uses webpack + PrismaPlugin to bundle both engines

3. **Vercel deployment** will have the correct engine and work properly ✅

## Verification

After running `npx prisma generate`, check the output:

✅ **Good - You should see**:
```
✔ Generated Prisma Client
```

Then check your build:

✅ **Good - Build succeeds**:
```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Generating static pages
```

## Still Having Issues?

1. **Delete and regenerate**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.prisma
   rm -rf prisma/generated
   npx prisma generate
   ```

2. **Check package versions match**:
   ```bash
   npm list @prisma/client prisma
   ```
   Both should be the same version (6.18.0)

3. **Verify environment variables in Vercel**:
   - `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly
   - Database is accessible from Vercel

**That's it!** The `binaryTargets` line is the key fix. 🎯
